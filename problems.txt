============
Go to the directory where you want to pull the code:
- git clone url_of_the_repo

To get latest from git
- git pull origin master




or create a new repository on the command line

echo "# python_problem_solving" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/tawfiqul27/python_problem_solving.git
git push -u origin master


or push an existing repository from the command line

git remote add origin https://github.com/tawfiqul27/python_problem_solving.git
