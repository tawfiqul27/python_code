# use of input function

name = input('Enter your name: ')
print('Your name is {}'. format(name))


a = 2
a = -2      # you can put + before the variable as well
print(f'Value of a is {a}')



#### Use of bitwise operator

x = 0x0a
y = 0x0b
z = x & y       # & is and operator and | is or operator, ^ xor operator,  >> 

print(f'(hex) x is {x:02x}, y is {y:02x}, z is {z:02x}')
print(f'(bin) x is {x:08b}, y is {y:08b}, z is {z:08b}')
