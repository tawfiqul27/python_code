Hello world

Lecture:

Conditional Structures:

What does the if __name__ == "__main__": do?

Whenever the Python interpreter reads a source file, it does two things:

    it sets a few special variables like __name__, and then

    it executes all of the code found in the file.

Let's see how this works and how it relates to your question about the __name__ checks we always see in Python scripts.



Lecture:
--------
Classes: classes are a great way of encapsulating functionality that can be kept together and passed around as a complete module to use another project 


The flow of python architecture is:

Interpreter module (datetime)----> Standard library ---> Classes (date, time, and datetime) [classes are predefined functions] 
 

Check for Locale in Python:
Locale is the local date and time format of your zone, and your computer.


Timedelta: 
So for example, given a particular date, you might want to calculate a date in the future or the past relative to that date. We can use the time delta class in Python to help us with this,A timedelta is baseically a span of time. It's not a particular date, it's not a particular time, it's a span of time. And you can use this class to perform time-based mathematics.

Difference between ptython 2 and 3:

****** In python2 print is a keyword and doesn't need parenthesis but in python3 print is a function and need a parenthesis.
****** In 2, there is one interger type but in 3 there is integer and long integer.
****** Code is not backward compatible from 2 to 3
****** 3 is a 10 years old package
****** For python3 in Mac and Windows, there is an editor available called Komodo.
****** In python, everything is an object.
	'Hello, world'.lower()'


******  ctrl + shift + r to run the code
****** ctrl + slash  to comment out any line
****** Inside print what we write is called print object

****** under class there could be functions. Sometimes functions are called methods, and variables inside a class is called properties. 

****** In python there is no difference between single quote or double quote


Check what is a constructor?

is, in, and, or, not, not in, is not are boolean operators.
