# For this exercise, we will keep track of when our friendâ€™s birthdays are, and be able to find that information based on their name. 
# Create a dictionary (in your file) of names and birthdays. When you run your program it should ask the user to enter a name, and 
# return the birthday of that person back to them. The interaction should look something like this:

# >>> Welcome to the birthday dictionary. We know the birthdays of:
# Albert Einstein
# Benjamin Franklin
# Ada Lovelace
# >>> Who's birthday do you want to look up?
# Benjamin Franklin
# >>> Benjamin Franklin's birthday is 01/17/1706.


# birthday = {'Amin Mohammad':'09-02-1990', 'Mohammad Naimur':'01-01-1991'}

# # a = input("Who's birthday you want to look up?")
# # print(birthday['Amin Mohammad'])

# for a in birthday.keys():
#     b = input("Who's birthday you want to look up?\n")
#     if b == 'Amin Mohammad':
#         print(birthday.get['Amin Mohammad'])
#     elif b == 'Mohammad Naimur':
#         print(birthday.get['Mohammad Naimur'])
#     else:
#         print('You entered a worng name.')
